# Minimal Game with Wallet Integration
A simple clicker game that connects to Keethings Wallet. This example demonstrates the complete wallet integration pattern used throughout Keeta Games.

## 📋 Quick Start Instructions

1. Copy the index.html and game.js code below into separate files
2. Place both files in the same folder
3. Open a terminal in that folder and run one of these commands:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server 8000 (Python)
    npx serve (Node.js)
    php -S localhost:8000 (PHP)
    ```
4. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
5. Click "Connect Wallet" to test!

⚠️ **Important: The wallet extension only works on HTTP/HTTPS URLs, not local file:// paths. You must use a web server!**
